The **Taiwan TDK Cup National University Creative Design and Robotics Competition** is one of Taiwan’s longest-running and largest robotics contests, co-organized by the Ministry of Education and the TDK Foundation since 1997.  

- **Objective**: To cultivate students' innovation, design, and hands-on integration skills in robotics.  
- **Competition Categories**:  
  - **Remote Control Group**: Manual operation tasks (e.g., obstacle crossing, item transport).  
  - **Autonomous Group**: AI-driven robots with vision recognition and path planning.  
  - **Flying Group** (occasional): UAV challenges like tunnel navigation and precision drops.  
- **Themes & Challenges**: Tasks are inspired by local culture or global issues (e.g., environmental protection, regional-themed missions like "Yunlin Hero Challenge" in 2025).  
- **Prizes**: Winners receive up to **NT$200,000**, with opportunities for international exchanges (e.g., visits to Japan’s NHK Robocon).  
- **Educational Impact**: Emphasizes practical skills in automation, AI, and mechanical design, aligning with industry needs.  
- **Recent Updates**: Hybrid/online formats were adopted during the pandemic, and some categories (e.g., Flying Group) may vary by year.
